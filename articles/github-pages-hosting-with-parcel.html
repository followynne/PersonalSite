        <h1>How to... host a site using Github Pages and Parcel</h1>
        <h2>Aye mate! If you are here, you want to deploy & publish a site using the free hosting offered by <a
                href="https://www.github.com">Github </a>
            and <a href="https://parceljs.org/">Parcel</a>, the latter as the bundler for all the
            packages/libraries you use in your site ðŸ˜Š</h2>
        <section id="intro">
            <div>If you're a beginner (as I were some months ago), you may be questioning, why do I need an
                hosting service and a bundler? Let me answer in the quickest & simplest way I can (click <a
                    href="#guide">Here</a> to go straight to the point instead).</br>
                <b>An hosting service is a service that will actually <i>hosts</i> all the files of your site and expose
                    them for public access.</b> Without this service, you would need to expose
                those files constantly to the world from your laptop! When you start messing around, it's very nice to
                have a free and good hosting service that you can use directly
                from your repository - that's where <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> comes in
                handy.</br>
                <b>A bundler is a tool that helps to bundle modules (libraries, a.k.a. reusables pieces of code) you use
                    in
                    your application in files ready to be included in your web pages and to be read by browsers.</b>
                Many bundlers exist for Javascript but Parcel has the great strength of being really
                <b>straight-forward and simple</b> to use! At the start of a web development career, you'll want to use
                libraries, frameworks, without additional overhead for their usage.<br />Bundlers like Webpack have a
                steep learning
                curve, due to its great customization
                options, and aren't really the best option for newcomers or small sites. Parcel, on the other hand, is
                simple to use
                and really good to start working on your skills!

            <h3>Guide</h3>
            <div>Okay, let's start assuming you have created your Hello World Site. You've created all the folders
                for your files, you've got your nice index.html ready and working, with the stylesheets and scripts
                correctly referenced inside.</br> You uploaded it on GitHub and it looks neat.</br> Let's assume you
                now want to use Bootstrap and JQuery without using a CDN, therefore you'll use a package manager and
                will create a bundle for your files and libraries ðŸ˜Š.</div>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <div>Install Node.js (that comes with npm) and then proceed to <b>install the libraries</b> you need
                        from the terminal:</div>
                    <pre lang="no-highlight">
<code>$ cd "your_folder_path"
$ npm init
$ npm i parcel
$ npm i bootstrap
$ npm i popper.js
$ npm i jquery</code>
</pre>
                    <div class="alert alert-warning">As you can see, at line 3 I made you install Parcel. You can also
                        install
                        it as a global package by typing <code class="text-bold">$ npm i parcel -g</code>
                        instead.<br />If you
                        choose to install it
                        globally, you'll be able to use it on different projects without needing to reinstall it each
                        time. In
                        this case, it's recommended to include parcel as a <a
                            href="https://flaviocopes.com/npm-peer-dependencies/" target="_blank">peer-dependency</a> in
                        your
                        package.json.
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    With <code>npm init</code> you create a package.json by filling the input provided. <b>Add the
                        following lines to your package.json</b>:
                    <pre>
<code>"scripts": {
    "start": "parcel ./*.html ./articles/*.html",
    "predeploy": "rm -rf dist && parcel build ./*.html ./articles/*.html --log-level verbose --public-url https://www.matteogregoricchio.com/ && cp CNAME ./dist && cp sitemap.xml ./dist",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
},</code></pre>We'll understand in a second what these lines mean.
                </li>
                <li>At the start of your Javascript entry point you require the libraries:
                    <pre lang="no-highlight">
<code>// index.js
import $ from 'jquery'
import 'popper.js'
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css'
import 'bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap'</code></pre> and then, in the same .js file you write a simple function to test
                    that the
                    import works:
                    <pre lang="no-highlight">
<code>// index.js
$(document).ready(()=>{
    $('body').html('Hello World, if you see this message Parcel Bundler and Github Hosting are working nicely!');
})</code></pre>
                    You ran Parcel by typing in the terminal <code>$npm run start</code>) and magic, it worked! Now we want to publish it using GH-Pages Hosting.</li>
                    <div>spiegare che cosa fa, Ã¨ che una shortcut x parcel index... sotto mettere il gitignore in alert</div>
                <div>First thing, in the <i>.gitignore</i> let's add those lines:
                    <pre lang="no-highlight">
<code>node_modules/
dist
.cache$ parcel index.html</code></pre>
                    then we need to install a new package from npm that will take care of creating the gh-pages branch
                    on
                    your remote repo:
                    <pre lang="no-highlight"><code>$ npm install gh-pages</code></pre>
                    Let's create a GH-Pages branch and push it to your remote repo:
                    <pre lang="no-highlight">
<code>$ git branch gh-pages
$ git checkout gh-pages
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "first commit"
$ git push origin gh-pages
$ git checkout master
$ npm install gh-pages</code></pre>
                </div>
                <div>We're back on the main branch, with our gh-pages running (you can check that the page is online in
                    your online repo, by going to Settings).</br>
                    Now we need to open the <i>package.json</i> to add this lines before <code>"dependencies":{</code>
                </div>
                <pre lang="no-highlight">
<code>"scripts": {
"start": "parcel index.html",
"predeploy": "rm -rf dist && parcel build index.html --public-url "paste here your ENTIRE REPO URL, comprehensive of http/https part"",
"deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
}</code></pre>
                <div>What are we doing? We are creating a script for npm that will execute those commands:
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Pre-Deploy</b>: it will delete the previous dist folder (the folder where are located the
                            processed
                            parcel files) + it will build the site from your entry point;</li>
                        <li><b>Deploy</b>: it will use gh-pages package to re-create the gh-pages branch based on the
                            dist
                            folder
                            and it will "commit&push" it to your remote repo</li>
                        <li><b>Start</b>: it will start parcel, to let you check what's been built.</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                <div><b>Please Note: if you have a CNAME file, containing the personalized url of your
                        site, you !MUST! substitute the "predeploy" line in the last snippet with:</b></div>
                <pre
                    lang="no-highlight"><code>"predeploy": "rm -rf dist && parcel build index.html --public-url "paste here your PERSONAL url, comprehensive of http/https part" && cp CNAME ./dist"</code></pre>
                <div>That's needed because this instruction will make Parcel build your page on the specified url and
                    it will copy the CPNAME file in the dist folder - this way GitHub will understand which custom
                    domain
                    you're
                    using. :)
                </div>
                </ul>

                <div>Now the job's easy: every time you have a new site build ready to deploy, you type this command in
                    Terminal:
                    <pre lang="no-highlight"><code>$ npm run deploy</code></pre>
                    Parcel will run, will build the site and deploy it to GitHub with all the dependencies you used and
                    are
                    needed by your scripts. Fast, easy, no CDN used :)</br>
