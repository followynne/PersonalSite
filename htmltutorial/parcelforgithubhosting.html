If you are here, you're searching for instructions to publish a site on the free hosting servers offered by GitHub, the popular site to host git remote repository, using Parcel as a bundler for all the packages/libraries you used in your site (ex:jquery, bootstrap...) :) Look no more, as here I've written a simple guide to use Parcel to bundle all those libraries and push the built pages on the gh-pages branch of your github repo.<br><br> For this tutorial, you'll need to have installed Node.Js, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a> (the Javascript package manager we'll use to install libraries and use parcel) and well, of course, <a href="https://parceljs.org/">Parcel</a>. For those operation you can find on the net loads of informations about. <br>Please, a note: all the commands that starts by the $ symbol are meant to be used in the Terminal (CMD) - that symbol stands only for formatting reasons, so don't write it when you copy the instruction. All the instructions and commands will be put inside a blockquote tag.</h5> <h5>Last reminder: if you want, you can find by clicking here: <a href="https://github.com/followynne/ParcelToPublishSiteOnGithub_SiteModel">||Site Model||</a> a model repository you can clone that was created with this tutorial. You'll find a published site you can take inspiration from at this url: <a href="https://followynne.github.io/ParcelToPublishSiteOnGithub_SiteModel/">Repo_Model</a>; you can check examples for package.json, index.html if you encounter problems in the process.</h5><br> <p></p>Okay, let's start by assuming you have created your Hello World Site. You've created all the folders for your files, you've got your nice index.html ready and working, with the stylesheet and scripts correctly put (please bear in mind it would be better to write paths for those files with the path starting with a full stop, when referring to folder/files on lower levels than the index ex: ./path/to/folder).<br>You uploaded it on GitHub and it looks neat.<br> After that, let's assume you want to use Bootstrap and JQuery so you installed the packages you need by using npm in the Terminal:<br> <blockquote class="bold">$cd [your folder path] $ npm init<br> $ npm install bootstrap<br> $ npm install popper.js<br> $ npm install jquery<br></blockquote> <br> At the start of your main javascript file you've imported the libraries: <blockquote class="bold">import $ from 'jquery'<br> import 'popper.js'<br> import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css'<br> import 'bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap'<br></blockquote> and in the same file you write a simple function to test the import: <blockquote class="bold"> $(document).ready(()=>{<br> $('body').html('<div>Hello World, if you see this messagge Parcel Bundler and Github Hosting are working nicely!</div>')<br> })</blockquote> You run parcel ($ parcel index.html) and magic, it works! Now we want to publish it using GH-Pages Hosting. <p></p> <p>First thing, in the .gitignore let's add those lines: <blockquote class="bold">node_modules/<br> dist<br> .cache</blockquote> then we need to install a new package from npm that will take care of creating the gh-pages branch on your remote repo: <blockquote class="bold">$ npm install gh-pages</blockquote> Let's create a GH-Pages branch and push it to your remote repo: <blockquote class="bold">$ git branch gh-pages<br> $ git checkout gh-pages<br> $ git add .<br> $ git commit -m "first commit"<br> $ git push origin gh-pages<br> $ git checkout master</blockquote> We're back on the main branch, with our gh-pages running up (you can check that the page is online in your online repo, by going to Settings).<br> Now we need to open the package.json file and we're gonna add this lines before the<br> "dependencies":{<br> line: <blockquote class="bold"> "scripts": {<br> "start": "parcel index.html",<br> "predeploy": "rm -rf dist && parcel build index.html --public-url ["your ENTIRE REPO URL,<br> comprehensive of http/https part"]",<br> "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"<br> },</blockquote> What are we doing? We are creating a script for npm that will execute those commands: <ol class="bold"> <li>Pre-Deploy: it will delete the previous dist folder (the folder where are located the processed parcel files) + it will build the site from your entry point;</li> <li>Deploy: it will use gh-pages package to re-create the gh-pages branch based on the dist folder and it will "commit&push" it to your remote repo</li> <li>Start: it will start parcel, to let you check what's been built.</li> </ol> </p> <p style="font-size:bold">Please Note: if you have a CNAME file, containing the personalized url of your site, you MUST use this line instead of the "predeploy" line you find up there:<br> <blockquote class="bold"> "predeploy": "rm -rf dist && parcel build index.html --public-url ["your PERSONAL url, comprehensive of http/https part"] && cp CNAME ./dist",</blockquote> That's needed because this instruction will make Parcel build your page on the url you request and, after that, will copy the CPNAME file in the dist folder - this way GitHub will understand which custom domain you're using. :) </p><br> <p>Now the job it's easy: every time you have a new site build ready to deploy, you type this command in Terminal: <blockquote class="bold">$ npm run deploy</blockquote> Parcel will run, will build the site and deploy it to GitHub with all the dependencies you used and are needed by your scripts. Fast, easy and way more appealing than using the CDN-Link Style. ;)<br></p> </div> </div> <footer class="main-footer"> <a href="mailto:matteo.gregoricchio@mail.com"> <img src="https://www.matteogregoricchio.com/mail-ic2.9a2bfbba.png" alt="mail" class="icona_social"></a> <a href="https://t.me/MatteoGregoric"> <img src="https://www.matteogregoricchio.com/teleg-ic.93546469.png" alt="telegram" class="icona_social"></a> <a href="https://github.com/followynne"> <img src="https://www.matteogregoricchio.com/icon_github.87fcc746.png" alt="profilegithub" class="icona_social"></a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matteo-gregoricchio"> <img src="https://www.matteogregoricchio.com/icon_linkedin.9d802a9b.png" alt="profilelinkedin" class="icona_social"></a> <a href="https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/_~01ca9d34312f7fa73d/"> <img src="https://www.matteogregoricchio.com/icon_upwork.301331f1.png" alt="profileupwork" class="icona_social"></a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/matteo_grcc/"> <img src="https://www.matteogregoricchio.com/icon_instagram.5a9c0149.png" alt="profileinstagram" class="icona_social"></a> <a href="https://psnprofiles.com/wigghi92"> <img src="https://www.matteogregoricchio.com/icon_ps.086f821e.png" alt="profileplaystation" class="icona_social"></a> <br><br> <p>&copy; 1992-2019 <a href="https://www.matteogregoricchio.com/img\easteregg.jpg" alt="easteregg">Matteo Gregoricchio</a></p> </footer> </body></html>
